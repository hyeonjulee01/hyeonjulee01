Hello, this is HyeonJu Lee.
I want to make a program to manage the students and everthing in tutoring academy.
So I decided to set this project for the program.
The name of this program is "알림장" that means a kind of diary writing the to-do list on.

The actors who use this program are a group of the students and a group of the teachers.
The main functions for the student group are to check the to-do list, to take the exam, to check the notice, to ask the questions to teachers and to check the schedule.
And the main functions for the teacher group are to register the to-do list, to make the exam, to register the notice, to answer the questions and to manage the schdule.

I use HTML, CSS, Javascript for UI, and JAVA for the back-end.
And I use MySQL as the DBMS.
